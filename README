# StevenA's bash startup files

These startup files are specific to my work. They are not suitable, as is, for anyone else. 

# Install
Running the install script will create symlinks in your home diretory to bashprofile and bashrc files in ./dot-files.

# Design
Global settings, aliases, and options are all set in bashrc. After this, it sources external files for: common functions, platform specific settings, machine specific settings, and work settings.

To add a new machine with a custom script, run the add_this_machine script. It will create a new file in the proper place and bring up your editor.

These scripts run on bash 4.4. No attempt is made to make them portable to other versions, or other shells.
